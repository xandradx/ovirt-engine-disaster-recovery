h1. HTML5 Validation

p. The HTML5 validation module provides a simple @#{input /}@ tag which can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing HTML @<input>@ elements. The @#{input /}@  tag will try to map existing data validation annotations from your Play! model to the HTML input element and thus provide near codeless client-side validation without even using JavaScript. On top of that it supports all available attributes from the original HTML input element and autofills the @name@ attribute by default.

h2. Usage

p. To use this module, simply replace those @<input>@ elements which need validation with the @#{input /}@ tag and specify the field from the corresponding model class using the @for@ attribute. All other attributes can just be copied from the existing @<input>@ element using the default Groovy syntax.

h2. Example

p. Suppose you have a Model class called @User@ which has a field called @name@ declared as


bq. @Required
@MaxSize(8)
@Match("[a-z]*")
public String name;

p. you can replace your existing @<input>@ element with the following:

pre. #{input for:'user.name', id:'yourID', class:'class1 class2' /}

The tag will then output the following HTML code:

pre. <input name="user.name" value="${user?.name}" id="yourID" class="class1 class2" required maxlength="8" pattern="[a-z]*">
